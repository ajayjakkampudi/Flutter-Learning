#### Scaffold
The Scaffold is a widget in Flutter used to implements the basic material design visual layout structure. It is quick enough to create a general-purpose mobile application and contains almost everything we need to create a functional and responsive Flutter apps. This widget is able to occupy the whole device screen. In other words, we can say that it is mainly responsible for creating a base to the app screen on which the child widgets hold on and render on the screen. It provides many widgets or APIs for showing Drawer, SnackBar, BottomNavigationBar, AppBar, FloatingActionButton, and many more.
